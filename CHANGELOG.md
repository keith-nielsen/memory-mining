## [0.1.8] - 2026-06-28

Token-minimum naming (Informed-Upheaval Protocol, conforming amendment) — the ≥3-token naming rule, codified as convention.

### Added
- **Token-Minimum Naming requirement** in `naming-rules`: every `.md` stem carries **≥3 hyphen-tokens
  — the floor, not the ceiling** (use *more* where the extra tokens add human-meaningful specificity).
  System-artifact families use `silo-section-descriptor` (silo first); content stems are ≥3-token
  slugs; dailies exempt. Existing sub-3 names grandfathered; **mechanical enforcement is deferred** to
  a later change (after the families conform). Agent guidance noted in `AGENTS.md`. See ADR-0015.

---

## [0.1.7] - 2026-06-27

Mold naming (Informed-Upheaval Protocol, conforming amendment) — self-identifying molds.

### Changed
- **Molds → `<note-type>-mold-blank.md`** — the four `97-Molds/` templates (`daily`, `effort`,
  `index`, `knowledge`) are renamed on the `silo-section-descriptor` convention so each mold is
  self-identifying in any flat / search / migrated view, and `index` no longer collides with the
  Catalog `<pillar>-index.md` notes. The `daily-note` script's mold path and the docs are repointed;
  the `vault-structure` Folder Structure listing is updated. No principle weakened (CONST-01 /
  INV-11 reinforced). See ADR-0014.

---

## [0.1.6] - 2026-06-19

Naming & identity (Informed-Upheaval Protocol, conforming amendment) — intuitive names + self-identifying artifacts.

### Changed
- **`moc → index`** — Catalog overview notes are now `<pillar>-index.md` (`type: index`); the mold,
  the `index_links` proposal field, and CONST-05's label "(MOCs)" → "(indexes)" follow. "MOC" (Map
  of Content) was opaque PKM jargon; "index" is self-teaching. The *principle* (domain via metadata
  + Catalog, never folders) is unchanged.
- **`_effort → <slug>/<slug>.md`** — a Site/Tailings/Spoil effort note is now the **folder-note**
  (stem == folder), self-identifying in any flat view (graph/search/migration) instead of an
  anonymous `_effort.md`. Maintenance scripts locate it as "the file whose stem equals its folder."
  See ADR-0013.

### Migration (existing forks/vaults)
- `git mv 40-Treasury/Catalog/<pillar>-moc.md → -index.md` (+ `home`); `git mv 30-Sites/<slug>/_effort.md → <slug>/<slug>.md`
  (and Tailings/Spoil); repoint wikilinks (`/_effort|` → `/<slug>|`, `-moc` → `-index`); re-render scripts.

### Process
- Constitution-override `naming-and-identity` (CONST-05 label, Tier 1), **authorized** by Keith Nielsen; ADR-0013.

---

## [0.1.5] - 2026-06-17

Spec-as-code runbooks + the daily close lifecycle (Informed-Upheaval Protocol, conforming amendment).

### Added
- **`96-Runbooks/` band** — operational procedures as harness-agnostic *spec-as-code* (schema:
  `99-Operations/schemas/runbook.md`; CI `runbook-lint`). Two charter runbooks: **`seal-provenance`**
  (forensic sealing) and **`close-daily`** (daily disposition sweep).
- **Daily close lifecycle** — `vault-close-day.py` assigns every daily item a disposition from a
  controlled vocabulary (`DISPOSITIONS`), writes an **append-only `## Close` manifest**, and sets
  `closed:`. Invariants: append-only, total-disposition, strict-order close, gated advance (capture
  is never gated). Deterministic (INV-6); AI invoked only at `unknown/other`. See ADR-0011, ADR-0012.
- Daily mold `closed:` field; `rollover` gated on the prior close; `daily-note` capture-home
  `⚠ BLOCKED` banner.
- `AGENTS.md` runbook pointer + agent operating notes; `CLAUDE.md` adapter.

### Changed
- `vault-structure` Folder Structure adds `96-Runbooks/` (reserved band `90–96 → 90–95`); CONST-04/02 upheld.
- `maintenance` spec: **Runbook Format** + **Daily Close Lifecycle** requirements.

### Process
- Constitution-override `spec-as-code-runbooks` (conforming amendment, Tier 1), **authorized** by
  Keith Nielsen; ADR-0011, ADR-0012.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-06-15

Lifecycle vocabulary refinement (Informed-Upheaval Protocol, CONST-01) + the project rename.

### Changed
- **Retired `prospect` as a Site status.** Prospecting is the *upstream, human* act that
  discovers Claims from the world — it is not a Site state. Sites are born at `dig`; the
  effort status set is now `dig | ore | slagged`. Updated `EFFORT_STATUSES`, the effort
  mold default, the kanban columns, the frontmatter schema, and the `value-pipeline` spec.
- **Locked the transition verbs:** `dig` (Claim→Site), `slag` (Site→Tailings),
  **`dump`** (Site→Spoil, renamed from `dispose` → `vault-dump.sh`), `redig`
  (Tailings→Site), `refine` (ore→bullion), **`bank`** (the human gate that authorizes
  bullion into the Treasury; state `authorized`). `reprospect` reclassified as the lone
  automatable read-only survey.
- New **Lifecycle Vocabulary** table in `docs/glossary.md`; CONST-01 chain updated to
  `Claim → Dig → Ore → Sort → Refine → Bank → Treasury → Polish`. See ADR-0010.
- **Renamed:** GitHub repo `memory-mining` → **`2026-AI-Value-Memory-Mining`** (year-prefixed
  Title-Kebab); internal project identity **`value-memory-mining`** (lower-kebab).

### Migration (existing forks/vaults)
- Drop `prospect` from `EFFORT_STATUSES` and set the effort mold default to `dig`;
  `git mv ~/bin/vault-dispose.sh` usage → `vault-dump.sh` (re-`render`).

### Process
- Constitution-override change `lifecycle-vocabulary` (CONST-01, Tier 1), **authorized**
  by Keith Nielsen; ADR-0010. CONST-01's principle is sharpened, not sacrificed.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-15

Constitutional correction (Informed-Upheaval Protocol) — Layer-2 folder ordering.

### Changed
- **Swapped `10-Claims` ↔ `20-Logbook`** so the daily logs sort to the top of the
  file explorer, conforming to CONST-04 ("daily logs at top"). The layout previously
  contradicted its own numbering principle. Result: `10-Logbook/` (the daily cockpit)
  now precedes `20-Claims/` (the capture inbox). The refine gate travels with Claims:
  `20-Claims/_refine-proposals/`, `20-Claims/_refine-approved/`, `20-Claims/_refine-queue.json`.
- Updated every path reference in lockstep — scripts, specs, the access-control matrix,
  schemas, molds paths, diagrams (Folder Stack), and the layout trees.

### Migration (for existing forks/vaults)
- `git mv 20-Logbook 10-Logbook` and `git mv 10-Claims 20-Claims`, then re-`render` the
  scripts. Anything pinned to the old paths (cron lines, external tooling) must update.

### Process
- Recorded as constitution-override change `swap-logbook-claims-order` (CONST-04, Tier 1)
  with human sign-off; see `openspec/adr/0009-layer2-ordering-correction.md`. CONST-04's
  principle text is unchanged — this is a corrective amendment, not an override.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-15

Documentation fills from dogfooding the live vault — Obsidian setup and the
Claim→Site promotion workflow.

### Added
- `docs/obsidian.md` — recommended Obsidian setup: core plugins; the
  **default-new-note-location → `10-Claims`** setting that keeps accidental/dangling-link
  notes out of the vault root; native Templates / Daily Notes for note creation; the
  Shell Commands + `flatpak-spawn --host` recipe for running maintenance scripts from
  the sandbox; and the Flatpak install + NVIDIA GL-extension matching note.
- `docs/method.md` → **"Promoting a Claim to a Site"** — the manual Claim→Site
  procedure, the single-source-of-truth cleanup discipline, and the three
  "where's my work?" indices (`30-Sites/`, the kanban board, the daily carry-over).

### Changed
- `vault-template/00-Docs/README.md` — clarified the two in-vault READMEs and noted that
  the full fork guide (`docs/USING-THIS-TEMPLATE.md`) and Obsidian guide (`docs/obsidian.md`)
  live in the template repo and do not copy into a forked vault; added pointers.
- `README.md` and `docs/USING-THIS-TEMPLATE.md` link the new Obsidian guide.

### Deferred (captured in docs, not built)
- A `vault-promote.sh` + an Obsidian "promote-from-inbox" punch-list button, a
  stray-fragment lint, and a `99-Operations` index MOC.

---

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-15

Adopter-friction fixes found by performing a real install of the template into a
live Obsidian vault.

### Added
- `vault-template/.gitignore` — a forked vault now ignores `.venv/`, `__pycache__`,
  the generated `10-Claims/_refine-queue.json`, and Obsidian per-machine UI state
  (`.obsidian/workspace*`, `.obsidian/cache`) out of the box. The template previously
  shipped without a vault-level `.gitignore`.

### Changed
- Setup now installs `python-frontmatter` into a **vault-local venv** at
  `$VAULT_ROOT/.venv` rather than the system Python, which modern distros block under
  PEP 668. `config.env` (and `config.env.example`) prepend `$VAULT_ROOT/.venv/bin` to
  `PATH`, so `source 99-Operations/config.env` activates the right interpreter for both
  manual ops and cron. Updated `README.md`, `docs/USING-THIS-TEMPLATE.md`, and
  `vault-template/00-Docs/README.md` accordingly.

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-15

First validated release. The deterministic engine (Phases 0–2) is proven against
the full PRD acceptance suite; Phase 3 (agent operations) remains spec-only/deferred.

### Added
- Initial repository structure: OpenSpec SDD scaffold, vault-template skeleton,
  constitution, 6 capability specs, 8 ADRs, 2 archived teaching changes,
  1 live change stub (add-telemetry-segment), CI pipeline, docs layer.
- Worked end-to-end example in `vault-template/00-Docs/examples/` (Claim → Treasury).
- `.github/scripts/validate-scripts.sh` — renders all 13 meta-scripts and runs
  `py_compile` + `shellcheck` + a fresh-vault pipeline smoke + the INV-11 executor
  boundary test. Wired as a CI matrix job (Python 3.12, 3.13).

### Fixed
- `config.env` used an HTML comment (`<!-- SPDX -->`) on line 1, which broke
  `source 99-Operations/config.env`. Changed to a shell comment (`# SPDX`).
- The literate-script render extractor used a non-line-anchored regex that
  truncated any script whose body contains a triple-backtick (notably
  `render-reconcile` itself). Anchored the closing fence to line start
  (`^``` ` with `re.MULTILINE`) in the script and both documented bootstrap
  snippets (`README.md`, `docs/USING-THIS-TEMPLATE.md`).
- The in-vault bootstrap (`00-Docs/README.md`) instructed running a `.md`
  meta-script note directly as Python; replaced with the code-block extraction step.
- Cron and ongoing-ops invocations set only `VAULT_ROOT`, so `vault-refine-detect.py`
  (needs `REFINE_GATE_GRADES`) and `vault-lint.py` (needs `PILLARS`/`GRADES`/
  `KNOWLEDGE_STAGES`) would `KeyError`. All documented invocations now source
  `config.env`.

### Changed
- Aligned proposal-schema MOC path examples with the kebab-case filenames
  (`<pillar>-moc.md`) used by the actual template (INV-11).
- Supported Python floor set to **3.12+** (was advertised as 3.10+, which the
  version matrix showed was not actually met).

### Validated
- Full PRD Phase 0→2 acceptance suite (A0.1–A2.6, plus orphan detector) against a
  sandboxed vault: 19/19 checks pass. All 13 operational scripts deploy via
  `render`, `reconcile` reports zero drift, and the refine pipeline
  (detect → propose → gate → execute), dispose, slag, rollover, kanban, linter,
  naming validator, and commit-gate hook all behave per spec.
- The documented onboarding was dogfooded literally end-to-end on a fresh vault.

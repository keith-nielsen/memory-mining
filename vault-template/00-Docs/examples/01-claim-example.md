# Claim: figure out git bisect

Burned ~3 hours today hunting the commit that broke the nightly build. Checked out
commits more or less at random and rebuilt each time. Painful and slow.

A colleague mentioned `git bisect` does this "automatically" with binary search —
sounds like it could have turned 3 hours into 20 minutes. Worth a proper look; it
could change how I handle every regression from here on.

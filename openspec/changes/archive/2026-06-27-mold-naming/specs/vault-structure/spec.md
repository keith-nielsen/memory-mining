## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Folder Structure

The vault root SHALL contain exactly these numbered top-level folders, ordered by touch
frequency (ascending number = higher daily-touch frequency, daily logs at top per
CONST-04), zero-padded for correct lexicographic sort, gapped by 10s for insertion
headroom.

Reserved number bands (folders NOT created until needed): 81–89 (Crucible-adjacent),
90–95 (future system).

`96-Runbooks/` holds **runbooks** — literate, schema-validated procedure notes (spec-as-code)
for repeatable, error-prone operations (e.g. `close-daily`, `seal-provenance`). It is
operational machinery (Layer-0-adjacent, like `97-Molds`/`99-Operations`), sorts in the
infra region per CONST-04, and conforms to the numbering scheme — it does not override it.

Rationale for the order: the daily note in `10-Logbook/Daily/` is the orienting surface
a user opens first each session, so it sorts to the top per CONST-04. `20-Claims/` is
the capture inbox (an unordered queue), and carries the refine gate
(`_refine-proposals/`, `_refine-approved/`).

The four `97-Molds/` files are named on the `silo-section-descriptor` convention
(`<note-type>-mold-blank.md`) so each mold is self-identifying in any flat / search /
migrated view and never collides with content (e.g. the Catalog `<pillar>-index.md` notes).
Scripts and the Obsidian Daily Notes template reference a mold by this filename.

#### Scenario: Folder tree is complete after Phase 0
- **WHEN** Phase 0 build completes
- **THEN** every directory in the structure above exists, including `20-Claims/_refine-proposals/`, `20-Claims/_refine-approved/`, `99-Operations/hooks/`, and `99-Operations/schemas/`

#### Scenario: Daily logs sort above the capture inbox
- **WHEN** the vault root is listed in any file explorer
- **THEN** `10-Logbook/` sorts above `20-Claims/`, placing the daily cockpit at the top (CONST-04)

#### Scenario: Runbooks sort in the infra region
- **WHEN** the vault root is listed in any file explorer
- **THEN** `96-Runbooks/` sorts below `80-Crucible/` and above `97-Molds/`, keeping operational procedures in the low-touch infra band (CONST-04 upheld)

#### Scenario: No pillar subfolders in Treasury
- **WHEN** the linter runs against `40-Treasury/`
- **THEN** it reports no subdirectories other than `Catalog/` (INV-12 enforced)

#### Scenario: Molds are self-identifying folder-notes
- **WHEN** the four `97-Molds/` files are listed flat (graph, search, or migration)
- **THEN** each stem reads `<note-type>-mold-blank` and none collides with a content stem such as `index`

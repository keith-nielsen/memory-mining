## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Token-Minimum Naming (≥3, silo-section-descriptor)

Every `.md` filename stem SHALL carry **at least three hyphen-separated tokens** — three is the
**floor, not the ceiling**. Authors SHALL use **more than three wherever the additional tokens supply
human-meaningful specificity**, because the namespace grows contention-prone as broad topics narrow
and digs reveal sub-sectors needing distinction; richer, more specific names pre-empt the overloading
that would otherwise collide later.

- **System-artifact families** (molds, operational scripts, Catalog indexes, schemas) SHALL use the
  **`silo-section-descriptor`** form, silo (subject) first — e.g. molds `<note-type>-mold-blank`.
- **Content stems** (Claims, Sites, Treasury notes) SHALL be ≥3-token topic slugs; longer is correct
  where it adds specificity (e.g. `swappable-stages-over-coresident-models`).
- **Dailies** (`YYYY-MM-DD`) are exempt (date-named).

This requirement is a **convention** at this stage: it governs new and renamed names through authoring
and review. Existing sub-three-token names are **grandfathered**; each family is brought into
conformance by its own change (molds: v0.1.7). **Mechanical enforcement** — extending `vault_naming.py`,
the commit-gate hook, and `naming-rules.json` to reject sub-three-token stems — is **deferred to a
later change**, sequenced after the families conform (turning on rejection earlier would block commits
on names not yet renamed).

#### Scenario: A new system-artifact name is silo-section-descriptor, ≥3 tokens
- **WHEN** a mold, script, Catalog index, or schema artifact is named or renamed
- **THEN** its stem is silo-first and carries at least three hyphen-separated tokens (e.g. `daily-mold-blank`)

#### Scenario: More tokens where specificity warrants
- **WHEN** a content topic narrows, or a dig reveals a sub-sector needing distinction
- **THEN** the stem carries more than three tokens to stay unambiguous (e.g. `swappable-stages-over-coresident-models`) rather than overloading a shorter name

#### Scenario: Dailies are exempt
- **WHEN** a daily note is named `YYYY-MM-DD`
- **THEN** the token-minimum does not apply

#### Scenario: Existing sub-three-token names are grandfathered at the convention stage
- **WHEN** this change is in effect and a pre-existing two-token name (e.g. `obsidian-usage`) is present
- **THEN** it is not rejected — the floor applies to new/renamed names by convention, and mechanical enforcement is deferred to a later change

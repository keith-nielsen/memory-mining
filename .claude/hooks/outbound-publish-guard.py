"""
Claude Code PreToolUse guard — outbound / exfil safety rail (INV-14).  PORTABLE.

Two jobs:
  1. HARD DENY any push / add-remote / repo-create / release that touches a deployed vault.
     The protected vault path is taken from $VAULT_ROOT (else $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR). When neither
     marks a vault (e.g. running in the public template repo), the vault-deny is inert and only
     job (2) applies.
  2. ASK (loud, unmissable banner) before ANY public repo creation or publish to a de-facto
     distribution hub — a PERMANENT, PUBLIC-FACING, effectively-irreversible record.

Output: Claude Code PreToolUse JSON on stdout. Exit 0 always (silent = defer to normal flow).
